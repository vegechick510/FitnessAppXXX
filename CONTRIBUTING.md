### <h2>Style Guides</h2>

#### Git Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
* When only changing documentation, include `[ci skip]` in the commit title


#### CoffeeScript Styleguide

* Set parameter defaults without spaces around the equal sign
    * `clear = (count=1) ->` instead of `clear = (count = 1) ->`
* Use spaces around operators
    * `count + 1` instead of `count+1`
* Use spaces after commas (unless separated by newlines)
* Use parentheses if it improves code clarity.
* Prefer alphabetic keywords to symbolic keywords:
    * `a is b` instead of `a == b`
* Avoid spaces inside the curly-braces of hash literals:
    * `{a: 1, b: 2}` instead of `{ a: 1, b: 2 }`
* Include a single line of whitespace between methods.
* Capitalize initialisms and acronyms in names, except for the first word, which
  should be lower-case:
  * `getURI` instead of `getUri`
  * `uriToOpen` instead of `URIToOpen`
* Use `slice()` to copy an array
* Add an explicit `return` when your function ends with a `for`/`while` loop and
  you don't want it to return a collected array.
* Use `this` instead of a standalone `@`
  * `return this` instead of `return @`
* Place requires in the following order:
    * Built in Node Modules (such as `path`)
    * Local Modules (using relative paths)
* Place class properties in the following order:
    * Class methods and properties (methods starting with a `@`)
    * Instance methods and properties


#### Documentation Styleguide

* Use [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown).
* Reference methods and classes in markdown with the custom `{}` notation:
    * Reference classes with `{ClassName}`
    * Reference instance methods with `{ClassName::methodName}`
    * Reference class methods with `{ClassName.methodName}`


## Git Commit Messages

  - Describe why any particular modification is being made.

  - Give a detailed description about the limitations of current code.

  - Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")

  - Limit the first line to 72 characters or less

## Python Style Guides :

  All Python code is linted with Pylint. Ensure that before you commit any changes, your code passes all the default pylint checks. Pylint can be installed with
  `pip install pylint`.
